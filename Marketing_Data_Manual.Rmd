## The DataMart

From the raw data your company provided on user demographics, poker statistics and daily interactions with products, deep insights can be drawn. Below is a description of the metrics put together to maximize your insights into your customers and their product use patterns.

## Table of Marketing Metrics

| Variable               | Type         | Description                                                                                             |

## Creating the DataMart and Important Marketing Metrics

To create the DataMart, we started by cleaning and processing the raw data provided. This included converting data into appropriate data types, removing duplicate values, handling missing bet values by filling with 0, and other general cleaning activities.

Once each raw dataset was cleaned, we transformed the data through aggregation to create a final table that was on a per user level AKA one row of data for each user. Through this aggregation, the initial marketing metrics were created as follows:

#### AGGREGATION SUMMARY PER USERID

We calculated the Total Aggregation Days (TotalAggDays) by selecting the first and last aggregation date for each user, and calculating the difference.

```         
DailyAgg <- DailyAgg %>%
  group_by(UserID) %>%
  mutate(
    FirstAggDate = min(Date),
    LastAggDate = max(Date),
    TotalAggDays = as.numeric(difftime(max(Date) + 1, min(Date), units = "days"))                                       
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

#### SUMMARY RELATED TO WINNING, STAKES, AND BETS

We calculated aggregated summary statistics of users' winnings, stakes and bets then found each user's earnings by subtracting stakes from winnings.

```         
DailyAgg <- DailyAgg %>%
  group_by(UserID) %>%
  arrange(UserID) %>% 
  mutate(TotalWinnings = sum(Winnings),
         AvgWinnings = mean(Winnings),
         TotalStakes = sum(Stakes),
         AvgStakes = mean(Stakes),
         TotalBets = sum(Bets),
         Earning = sum(Winnings - Stakes))
```

#### TOTAL PRODUCTION DESCRIPTION

We created the Total product description for each UserID & Earning Per Customerby aggregating by userID and concatenating all unique product descriptions associated with that user.

```         
DailyAgg <- DailyAgg %>%
  group_by(UserID) %>%
  arrange(ProductID) %>%                                                                     
  mutate(AllProductDescriptions = paste(unique(`Product Description`), collapse = ", ")) 
```

#### COUNTS OF PRODUCTION DESCRIPTION OCCURENCES

We calculated how many users had each specific combination of products in order to find the most popular product combinations.

```         
DailyAgg <- DailyAgg %>%
  group_by(UserID, AllProductDescriptions) %>%
  mutate(ProductComboCount = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

#### SUMMARY FOR EACH PRODUCT

We calculated aggregated summary statistics by individual user for each product. The statistics we gathered were sum and average of winnings, sum and average of stakes, sum of bets and the earnings calculated in the same manner as previously described. Here is an example code for product Casino BossMedia.

```         
PRODUCT <- DailyAgg %>% 
  group_by(UserID,ProductID)%>%
  summarise(Cas_BM_TWin = ifelse( `Pro Casino BossMedia`  == 1, sum(Winnings),0),
            Cas_BM_AWin = ifelse(`Pro Casino BossMedia` == 1, mean(Winnings),0),
            Cas_BM_TStakes = ifelse(`Pro Casino BossMedia` == 1, sum(Stakes),0),
            Cas_BM_AStakes = ifelse(`Pro Casino BossMedia`== 1, mean(Stakes),0),
            Cas_BM_TBets = ifelse(`Pro Casino BossMedia` == 1, sum(Bets),0),
            Cas_BM_Earn = ifelse(`Pro Casino BossMedia` == 1, sum(Winnings-Stakes),0))
```

#### TOTAL DATE OF PLAYING

We created a variable to capture the length of time in days a user has played for.

```         
PokerChip <- PokerChip %>% 
  group_by(UserID) %>% 
  mutate(TransactionDays = as.numeric(difftime(max(TransDateTime) + 1, min(TransDateTime), units = "days")))
```

#### TIMES OF PLAYING

We considered each sell action as one time of playing. Here we count how many times each User played.

```         
PokerChip <- PokerChip %>% 
  filter(tolower(TransType) == "sell") %>% 
  group_by(UserID) %>%
  mutate(TimesOfPlaying = n())
```

#### TRANSACTION SUMMARY

We calculated the total buy and sell amount for each user.

```         
# Summarize buy and sell amount for each customer
PokerChip <- PokerChip %>%
  group_by(UserID) %>%
  mutate(Buy_Amount = sum(TransAmount[TransType == "Buy"]),
         Sell_Amount = sum(TransAmount[TransType == "Sell"]))
```

#### LENGTH OF RELATIONSHIP

We calculated the Length of relationship as the time gap between registration date and last betting activity date.

```         
DataMart <- DataMart%>%
  mutate(LoR = LastAggDate - RegDate)
#convert Length of Relationship to numeric for future calculations
DataMart$LoR_days <- as.numeric(DataMart$LoR, units='days')
DataMart <- subset(DataMart, select = -c(LoR))
```

#### TIME TO FIRST BET

We calculated Time to first bet as the time gap between registration date and first betting activity date.

```         
DataMart <- DataMart%>%
  mutate(TimeToFirstBet = FirstAggDate - RegDate)
#convert Length of Relationship to numeric for future calculations
DataMart$TimeToFirstBet_days <- as.numeric(DataMart$TimeToFirstBet, units='days')
DataMart <- subset(DataMart, select = -c(TimeToFirstBet))
```

#### LOYALTY

Loyalty shows the relationship between user's total bets and the length of relationship.

```         
DataMart <- DataMart%>%
  mutate(Loyalty = TotalBets/LoR_days)
```

#### SPEND CATEGORIES

We calculated the total spending of each user.

```         
DataMart <- DataMart%>%
  mutate(TotalSpend = Buy_Amount - Sell_Amount - Earning )
```

Using these total amounts, we calculated summary statistics on total spend to determine spend categories

```         
summary(DataMart$TotalSpend)
```

We found the minimum Total Spent by a user was \$-37,037.76, Median was \$49.60, Average was \$201.75 and the maximum was \$76,165.57

Then we created a function to categorize the TotalSpend column into categories: Low Spend, Medium Spend, High Spend and Profit Risk (AKA users who win more than they spend) through the use of an lapply function.

```         
category <- function(x){
  if (is.na(x)){
    return('N/A')
  }else if (x<0){
    return('PROFIT RISK')
  }else if ((x>=0)&(x<=50)){
    return('low')
  }else if ((x>50)&(x<=1000)){
    return('medium')
  }else {
    return('high')
  }
}

DataMart$SpendCategory <- unlist(lapply(DataMart$TotalSpend, category))
```

#### AVGWINNINGS BY PRODUCT COMBINATION

We then looked at average winnings across all product combinations that users had in order to see trends across popular product combinations.

```         
Avgwin <- DataMart %>%
  group_by(AllProductDescriptions) %>%
  summarise(TotalAvgWins = mean(AvgWinnings))
```

#### TOTAL BETS BY PRODUCT COMBINATION

This process was repeated with total bets data.

```         
AvgTotBet <- DataMart %>%
  group_by(AllProductDescriptions) %>%
  summarise(AvgTotalBets = mean(TotalBets))
```

#### TIMETOFIRSTBET_DAYS BY PRODUCT COMBINATION

Finally, we looked at the average number of days until a users first bet aggregated by their specific product combination.

```         
AvgDaysToFirstBet <- DataMart %>%
  group_by(AllProductDescriptions) %>%
  summarise(AvgDaysToFirstBet = mean(TimeToFirstBet_days, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Summary Statistics

These marketing metrics can be best explored on our convenient Shiny App, however for ease, we've highlighted key summary statics for each app section.

### APP TAB 1 \|GEOGRAPHICAL IMPACT

For the Geographical impact, we want to check the number of customer and cutomer earning per country.

```{r maps_plot, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/bmurugesan1/OneDrive - IESEG/Documents/GROUP2_SubmissionFINAL_Ying_Alice_Bharanidharan/GROUP2_SubmissionFINAL_Ying_Alice_Bharanidharan/MapPlot.png")

```

We found that most of our user (24k) are German and they earn in total 2.9 million Euro. However, we only have 190 users in Sweden, their earning is negative 2.7 million in total.

### APP TAB 2 \| USER ANALYSIS

In this part, we mainly visualize the length of relationship and time to first bet.

```{r barchart_LOR, echo=FALSE}
# Bar chart: Length of Relationship (LOR)

    ggplot(DataMart, aes(x = LoR_days)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "count", fill = "#5bc0de", alpha = 0.7) +
      labs(title = "Length of Relationship (LOR) Distribution", x = "Length of Relationship (Days)", y = "Number of Users") +
      theme_minimal()

```

We observed that the majority of users can be categorized into two groups:

quick churn users (LOR less than 25 days)

loyal users (LOP greater than 200 days)

There are over 1000 individuals who only attempt for one day.

Overall, the number of loyal users is significantly high.

```{r barchart_TimeFirstBet, echo=FALSE}

    time_to_first_bet_data <- DataMart %>% 
      group_by(UserID) %>%
      summarise(TimeToFirstBet_days = max(TimeToFirstBet_days, na.rm = TRUE))
    
    ggplot(time_to_first_bet_data, aes(x = TimeToFirstBet_days)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "count", fill = "#62c462", alpha = 0.7) +
      labs(title = "Time to First Bet Distribution", x = "Time to First Bet (Days)", y = "Count") +
      theme_minimal()

```

More than 95% of the Users play at the first day they registered. 99% of the users play within 25 days.

### APP TAB 3 \| LENGTH OF RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS

Users with longer relationships typically exhibit a sustained pattern of transactions over time, indicating their continuous engagement with the platform. However, there is also a subset of these users with relatively shorter transaction days. Overall, there is a clear positive correlation between transaction days and the length of the relationship.

```{r scatter_transLOR, echo=FALSE}

    scatter_data <- DataMart %>% filter(TransactionDays > 0, LoR_days > 0)
    
    plot_ly(scatter_data, x = ~LoR_days, y = ~TransactionDays, mode = "markers",
            marker = list(size = 10, opacity = 0.8, color = ~TransactionDays, colorscale = "Viridis")) %>%
      layout(title = "Scatter Plot: Transaction Days vs LOR",
             xaxis = list(title = "Length of Relationship (Days)"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Transaction Days"),
             paper_bgcolor = "#f5f5f5",
             font = list(color = "#333333"))
```

### APP TAB 4 \| GENDER INSIGHTS

When inspecting the gender of all users, we find the vast majority of users are men. This should be accounted for in all marketing endeavors.

```{r gender_plot, echo=FALSE}
    gender_data <- DataMart %>%
      group_by(Gender) %>%
      summarise(count = n())
    
    plot_ly(gender_data, labels = ~Gender, values = ~count, type = "pie", hole = 0.6)
```

### APP TAB 5 \| SPENDING CATEGORIZATION INSIGHTS

When inspecting the categorization of user spending, we see that most users fall into the Low or Medium categories, spending between \$0 - \$1,000 on products. High spenders spending more than \$1,000 on products are the smallest group although the maximum spend is \$`r format(max(DataMart$TotalSpend), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE, digits = 2, trim = TRUE)`.

Most interestingly, 15% of users are considered a Profit Risk meaning they win more money than they spend on products. These users should be flagged for special consideration in future marketing activities to either increase their spending, play with new products or discourage use of the products all together.

```{r SpendCategory_plot, echo=FALSE}

    SpendCat_data <- DataMart %>%
      group_by(SpendCategory) %>%
      summarise(count = n())
    
    plot_ly(SpendCat_data, labels = ~SpendCategory, values = ~count, type = "pie", hole = 0.6)

```

### APP TAB 6 \| PRODUCT COMBINATION INSIGHTS

Looking into the specific product combinations that users frequently use and how they impact their earnings and winnings can provide very valuable marketing insight. It can guide product bundling opportunities, assist in user segmentation and targeting and provide insights on how users play across products. Below please find the top 10 most popular product combinations.

```{r ProductCombo_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10}
top_10_products <- DataMart %>%
      select(AllProductDescriptions, ProductComboCount) %>%
      distinct(AllProductDescriptions, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
      arrange(desc(ProductComboCount)) %>%
      head(10)
    # Create the bar graph
    ggplot(top_10_products, aes(x = AllProductDescriptions, y = ProductComboCount, fill = AllProductDescriptions)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      labs(title = "Top 10 Most Common Product Combos",
           x = NULL,
           y = NULL) +
      theme_minimal() +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Hide x-axis labels
            legend.title = element_blank(),  # Hide legend title
            legend.position = "right")
```
